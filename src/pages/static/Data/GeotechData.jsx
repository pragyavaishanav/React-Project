It primarily functions as a tool for mitigating risks, validating engineering design and quantifying impact on the surrounding environment. Current state of monitoring technologies is however limited in its scope and can benefit in a major way from the next big thing â€“ Digital Twin technology.",
      "Instrumentation and monitoring combined with finite elements, machine learning, risk assessment and performance based decision making can be used to replicate physical assets in the digital world. These digital twins will be able to predict the behaviors of their physical twins before those behaviors are manifested in reality. In other words, Digital Twin is a replica of a physical asset in the digital format. This digital replica is also capable of mapping responsiveness of surrounding environment on physical asset.",
      "This technology today is having a major impact on the Manufacturing industry. Arrays of sensors collect data from the shop floor. These data sets are processed through intelligent algorithms that can predict failures and alert on upcoming maintenance.",
      "Construction Industry is also on the grasp of major breakthroughs and can benefit in a real way from this technology. For example, say a finite element Model of the tunneling section can be continuously improved from the variable data obtained through distributed sensors. This model then can be used to tweak the tunneling parameters and machine behavior. Further, this data set then can be used to select tunneling parameters for future projects in similar conditions",
